# Game-Engine
This project is university practice task.And this is my solution to the task.

We have teams that fight each other. Every team can have monster and/or knight as a units. Every unit have stats for its equipment(if knight - sword/shield, if monster - nails,tooth)
The game run in turns. Each turn every unit moves toward unit from different team. If they are in attack range area they damage eachother.

I have plans to futer upgrade this project adding some kind of visuals, make creation of the units to be automatic(randomize), adding more stats and make the units more smarter.
